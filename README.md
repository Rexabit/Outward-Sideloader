# Outward-Sideloader

Partiality Sideloader for Outward Assets (currently textures only)

* Credits to Elec0 (https://github.com/Elec0) for the base mod

How to use:

* Create a folder in Outward directory \Mods\Resources\Texture2D
* place .PNG texture files in here, with the exact name they have in game (use UABE or AssetStudio to find textures/names)
* run .dll with Partiality (place in \Mods\) and your textures will be applied.
