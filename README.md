# Outward-Sideloader

Partiality "Sideloader" for Outward Assets (currently *replaces* textures only)

* Credits to Elec0 (https://github.com/Elec0) for the base mod

How to use:

* Create a folder in Outward directory: ...\Outward\Mods\Resources\Texture2D\
* place .PNG texture files in \Texture2D\ folder, with the exact name they have in game (use UABE or AssetStudio to find textures/names).
* Place the .dll file in Outward\Mods\\, run with Partiality, and your textures will be applied.

Notes:
* Item, character and other material textures should all be supported.
* Menu assets not currently supported. 
* bump maps not currently supported
